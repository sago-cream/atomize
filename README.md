# [Atomize](https://atomize.hsichen.dev)

A web app game built around fast prime factorization.

## Game modes

### Solo

Challenge your best score and grind your skills.

### Duel

Face off against a friend in real time. Outsmart them with faster factorization and hit them hard with the combos.

## PWA (web app) installation

Atomize ships with a web app manifest and standalone display mode, so it can be installed like an app.

### iPhone or iPad (Safari)

1. Open Atomize in Safari.
2. Tap the Share button.
3. Choose `Add to Home Screen`.
4. Confirm the app name and tap `Add`.

### Android (Chrome)

1. Open Atomize in Chrome.
2. Tap the browser menu.
3. Choose `Install app` or `Add to Home screen`.
4. Confirm the install prompt.

### Desktop (Chrome, Edge, or other Chromium browsers)

1. Open Atomize in the browser.
2. Click the install icon in the address bar, if shown.
3. Or open the browser menu and choose `Install Atomize`.
4. Confirm the install prompt.

## Install for development

1. Install dependencies with [Bun](https://bun.com/):

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2. Start the dev server:

    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

3. Open the app in your browser:

    ```text
    http://127.0.0.1:5173
    ```

To enable multiplayer locally, create `.env.local` in the repository root:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Local Supabase

The tracked `supabase/config.toml` uses PostgreSQL 17, anonymous sign-in, Auth,
Storage, and Realtime to match Atomize's hosted project without storing a token
or project credential. Start the local backend, reset it from tracked
migrations, and regenerate database types with:

```bash
bun run backend:start
bun run backend:reset
bun run backend:types
```

Maintainers can link the checkout to the hosted Atomize project after logging
in with the Supabase CLI:

```bash
bunx supabase@2.109.1 link --project-ref <project-ref>
bun run backend:types:remote
```

Link state and local environment files remain ignored under `supabase/.temp`
and `supabase/.env*.local`. Never commit a service-role key.
The CLI exposes its development ports on the host, so use this stack only on a
trusted network with the host firewall enabled and stop it when finished.

Production provider ownership and capacity boundaries are recorded in
[`PROVIDERS.md`](PROVIDERS.md).

## Development checks

Run web checks from the terminal:

```bash
bun run lint
bun run build
```

The build includes TypeScript checking. For native changes, run the checks that
cover the affected behavior:

| Change                         | Check                         |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Gameplay rules or save data    | `bun run godot:test`          |
| Screen rendering               | `bun run godot:smoke`         |
| Mobile navigation and tutorial | `bun run godot:mobile-flow`   |
| Solo and battle gameplay       | `bun run godot:gameplay-flow` |
| Menu interactions              | `bun run godot:menu-flow`     |

See [the native setup guide](godot/README.md) for Godot requirements and live
backend checks. Inspect changed UI in the relevant client and include matched
before/after evidence in UI pull requests. Documentation-only changes need link
and formatting checks, not an editor or running app.

## Godot mobile port

The parallel Godot iOS/Android port lives in `godot/`. The Vite app remains the
web/PWA client. See `godot/README.md` for the Windows, macOS, and Linux setup
guide, parity tests, and mobile export commands.
